# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing Morgan RAG with an advanced vectorization and search system inspired by the proven patterns from InspecTor. The goal is to implement production-grade vectorization capabilities while maintaining Morgan's KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles and human-first approach.

The enhancement will provide Morgan with sophisticated document processing, intelligent chunking, hierarchical search, and performance optimization while keeping the interface simple and user-friendly.
