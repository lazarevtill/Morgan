## KISS Architecture Principles

### Modular Design Philosophy
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Clean Interfaces**: Simple, well-defined APIs between modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Modules depend on abstractions, not implementations
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled through configuration, not code changes
- **Local-First**: All processing happens locally, no external API dependencies (except gpt.lazarev.cloud)
